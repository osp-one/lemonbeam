# LemonBeam Technical Decisions

## Purpose

This document records important project decisions and the reasons behind them.

It owns the **why** behind major product and technical choices.

Implementation details belong in their owning documents:

- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — product problem, MVP scope, guide format, user flow, evaluation goals, and stretch features
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system components, directory structure, analysis pipeline, and orchestration
- `API_CONTRACT.md` — routes, request and response shapes, status codes, and errors
- `DATABASE.md` — SQLite tables, columns, relationships, indexes, and lifecycle
- `TESTING.md` — testing strategy, tools, commands, and evaluation procedures
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Git workflow and contribution practices
- `AGENTS.md` — AI-agent behavior and boundaries

When a decision changes, update this file and the document that owns the affected implementation details.

## Web Application as the MVP

### Decision

LemonBeam’s MVP will be a web application.

The user submits a supported public GitHub repository through a React interface and receives a generated guide in the browser.

### Reasons

- A web application provides a clear end-to-end user experience.
- It avoids requiring users to install LemonBeam locally.
- It gives the team one primary delivery path to design, build, and test.
- It keeps the MVP focused within the available project timeline.

### Consequences

- The frontend and backend communicate through an HTTP API.
- Local CLI behavior is not required for the MVP.
- CLI support remains a stretch goal.

---

## CLI as a Stretch Goal

### Decision

A LemonBeam CLI is outside the MVP.

A future CLI may scan a local repository and store generated output in a local `.lemonbeam` directory.

### Reasons

- Supporting both a web application and a CLI would increase scope.
- Local repository handling introduces a separate workflow and additional design questions.
- The team should complete the web experience before adding another interface.

### Consequences

- MVP documentation and implementation should not depend on CLI commands.
- CLI-specific files and workflows should not be introduced into the MVP without a scope change.

---

## Public GitHub Repositories Only

### Decision

The MVP supports public repositories hosted on GitHub.

Private repositories, GitLab, and Bitbucket are outside the MVP.

### Reasons

- Public GitHub repositories can be validated and downloaded without building an authorization system.
- Limiting repository providers reduces integration complexity.
- It avoids handling private repository credentials during the MVP.

### Consequences

- Repository validation is GitHub-specific.
- Private repository support remains a stretch goal.
- Other repository providers require future integration work.

---

## JavaScript and TypeScript Only

### Decision

The MVP supports JavaScript and TypeScript repositories.

### Reasons

- Supporting a smaller language set keeps parsing, classification, and retrieval rules manageable.
- Tree-sitter support can be focused on JavaScript and TypeScript.
- The team can evaluate guide quality within a defined ecosystem.

### Consequences

- Repositories centered on other languages are rejected as unsupported.
- Additional language ecosystems remain stretch goals.

---

## Single-Package Repositories Only

### Decision

The MVP supports single-package repositories and does not support monorepos.

### Reasons

- Monorepos introduce multiple package boundaries, scripts, applications, and configuration contexts.
- Determining which package or application a guide statement applies to would add substantial complexity.
- Single-package repositories provide a clearer unit of analysis for the MVP.

### Consequences

- Repositories with multiple separate applications or package boundaries are rejected as unsupported.
- Monorepo support remains a stretch goal.

---

## Default Branch and Exact Commit Identification

### Decision

LemonBeam scans the repository’s default branch and records the exact commit SHA being analyzed before downloading the source snapshot.

### Reasons

- The commit SHA identifies the precise repository version used to generate the guide.
- Citations and claims can be tied to a stable source version.
- The same repository may change after a guide is generated.

### Consequences

- Repository metadata returned with the guide includes the default branch and commit SHA.
- Regenerating a guide after repository changes may produce different evidence and output.

---

## GitHub Integration for Validation and Snapshot Access

### Decision

LemonBeam uses GitHub integration to validate repositories, retrieve repository metadata, identify the default branch and commit SHA, and access the source snapshot.

### Reasons

- GitHub metadata supports validation before downloading a repository.
- The exact repository version can be identified before analysis begins.
- It provides a cleaner web workflow than depending only on a local `git clone` process.

### Consequences

- GitHub-specific behavior belongs in the backend’s GitHub integration area.
- External GitHub failures must be handled by the backend.
- Exact implementation details belong in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## Multiple Parsing and Chunking Strategies

### Decision

LemonBeam uses different parsing and chunking strategies based on file type.

Tree-sitter is one parsing method, not the universal parser for every file.

### Reasons

- Source code, Markdown, configuration files, and unknown text have different structures.
- A single strategy would not handle every file type well.
- File-appropriate strategies preserve meaning more effectively.

### Consequences

- Supported JavaScript and TypeScript code uses Tree-sitter.
- Markdown uses heading- and section-based chunking.
- Configuration files use structured or rule-based handling.
- Unsupported readable text may use heuristic, regex, fallback chunking, or be skipped.

---

## File Classification Before Chunking

### Decision

LemonBeam discovers and classifies files before choosing a parsing and chunking strategy.

### Reasons

- The file purpose helps determine which chunker should process the file.
- Source, tests, documentation, configuration, scripts, types, and unknown files need different handling.
- Classification makes later retrieval more predictable.

### Consequences

The analysis order is:

```text
Discover
-> classify
-> choose parser and chunker
-> parse
-> chunk
-> store
```

Files with insufficient evidence remain uncategorized rather than being forced into an incorrect category.

---

## Rule-Based Retrieval Instead of Vector Search

### Decision

The MVP retrieves repository evidence using deterministic rules over SQLite metadata rather than vector similarity.

### Reasons

- Rule-based retrieval is explicit and inspectable.
- The team can explain why a chunk was selected for a guide section.
- The same rules applied to the same repository version should select the same evidence.
- It reduces the number of new systems required for the MVP.

### Consequences

- Each guide section requires carefully designed retrieval rules.
- Missing a relevant signal may leave a gap in a section.
- Vector-based retrieval remains a stretch goal for later comparison.

---

## Raw SQL for Retrieval

### Decision

Section-specific retrieval uses raw SQL rather than an ORM or query builder.

### Reasons

- Retrieval is primarily filtering, joining, and ranking structured evidence rather than standard CRUD.
- Raw SQL keeps retrieval logic explicit and reviewable.
- Queries can be inspected and optimized directly.
- It avoids adding an abstraction layer that the MVP does not require.

### Consequences

- Queries should use parameters or prepared statements.
- SQL should remain readable and testable.
- An ORM or query builder should not be added without revisiting this decision.

---

## Isolated Temporary SQLite Database per Scan

### Decision

Each repository scan uses its own isolated temporary SQLite database.

The database and other temporary scan files are deleted after the scan lifecycle is complete.

### Reasons

- Scan data belongs to one repository version and one generation request.
- Isolation prevents evidence from different scans from mixing.
- LemonBeam does not need permanent user history for the MVP.
- SQLite provides structured filtering without requiring a hosted database.

### Consequences

- The application does not use one shared `lemonbeam.sqlite` file for all users.
- Each scan requires a unique workspace and database path.
- Cleanup must remove the repository snapshot, SQLite database, and intermediate files.
- Persistent scan history and caching are outside the MVP.

---

## No User Accounts or Saved Scan History

### Decision

The MVP does not include user accounts or persistent scan history.

### Reasons

- Authentication and persistent user data would expand the project scope.
- The main value of the MVP is repository analysis and guide generation.
- Temporary scan storage is sufficient for the initial workflow.

### Consequences

- Users keep only the guide files they choose to download.
- The application does not provide a dashboard of past scans.
- Account and history features require a future scope decision.

---

## Five Primary Tasks and Five LLM Calls

### Decision

LemonBeam generates five primary guide sections through five independent generation tasks and five LLM calls.

The sections are:

1. Project Overview
2. Setup / Installation
3. Running Locally
4. Project Structure
5. Testing

### Reasons

- Each section needs different evidence and a different prompt focus.
- Bounded tasks are easier to test and debug than one large generation request.
- One weak retrieval result should not derail the entire guide.
- Five sections cover the core contributor-onboarding needs while controlling cost and complexity.

### Consequences

- Each task performs section-specific retrieval.
- Each task uses its matching prompt.
- Each task returns section text, citations, and uncertainty information.
- The orchestration layer combines the completed results.

---

## Programmatically Assembled Uncertainty Section

### Decision

The sixth displayed section, **Uncertainties and Missing Information**, is assembled from uncertainty information returned by the five primary section tasks.

It does not use a sixth LLM call.

### Reasons

- The primary tasks are already responsible for identifying evidence gaps.
- Aggregating their uncertainty results preserves those reports directly.
- Another LLM call would add cost without being necessary.
- Programmatic assembly makes the origin of uncertainty items clearer.

### Consequences

- The completed guide contains six displayed sections.
- Only five sections are LLM-generated.
- Uncertainty output should not be silently rewritten into unsupported conclusions.

---

## Section-Specific Prompts with a Shared Result Shape

### Decision

Each primary guide task uses a section-specific prompt, while all tasks return results in a consistent shape.

### Reasons

- Each section asks different questions of the repository evidence.
- A common result shape allows the orchestration code to handle every task consistently.
- Shared citation and uncertainty fields simplify validation and assembly.

### Consequences

- Prompt wording differs by section.
- The orchestration flow can process each section result through the same shared steps.
- The exact prompt text belongs in the prompt source files, not in project documentation.

---

## Source-Backed Claims and Citation Validation

### Decision

Generated guide claims must be supported by repository evidence and include citations.

When evidence is missing or unclear, LemonBeam reports uncertainty rather than guessing.

### Reasons

- Users need to verify important setup, running, structure, and testing claims.
- Source-backed output is more trustworthy than unsupported AI explanation.
- Citations make retrieval and generation quality easier to evaluate.

### Consequences

- The LLM receives source evidence selected for its section.
- Returned citations must correspond to repository evidence.
- Unsupported repository facts should not appear as confident claims.

---

## Markdown-Only Guide Output for the MVP

### Decision

The MVP returns and supports a Markdown guide.

HTML guide export is a stretch feature.

### Reasons

- Markdown is simple to generate, display, copy, store, and download.
- Supporting multiple output formats adds rendering and consistency work.
- One output format keeps the MVP focused.

### Consequences

- The API returns `guide.markdown`.
- The frontend supports reading, copying, and downloading `guide.md`.
- HTML output is not part of the MVP API contract.

---

## Single Scan Endpoint

### Decision

The MVP uses:

```text
POST /api/scans
```

to submit a repository URL and receive the completed guide.

### Reasons

- The MVP has one primary user action.
- A single route keeps frontend and backend integration straightforward.
- The current workflow does not require a larger public API.

### Consequences

- Exact request, response, status, and error formats belong in `API_CONTRACT.md`.
- Additional endpoints should be added only when a new product requirement requires them.

---

## Strict Request Validation

### Decision

The scan endpoint rejects request fields that are not defined in the API contract.

### Reasons

- The request body is intentionally small.
- Strict validation catches misspelled fields and unexpected input.
- The frontend and backend are both maintained by the LemonBeam team.
- It keeps the API behavior precise.

### Consequences

- Unexpected fields return `400 Bad Request`.
- The backend uses the `INVALID_REQUEST_BODY` error code for unsupported request fields.
- Validation behavior must match `API_CONTRACT.md`.

---

## Documentation Ownership

### Decision

Each project concept has one owning document.

Other documents should reference that source of truth rather than repeat the same details.

### Reasons

- Repeated information can become inconsistent.
- Changes should be made in one place.
- Clear ownership makes documentation easier to maintain.

### Consequences

- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` owns product scope and guide format.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` owns system structure and component responsibilities.
- `API_CONTRACT.md` owns frontend/backend communication.
- `DATABASE.md` owns the SQLite design.
- `TESTING.md` owns testing and evaluation procedures.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` owns contribution practices.
- `AGENTS.md` owns AI-agent behavior.
- This file owns the reasons behind major decisions.

---

## Human-Led Implementation

### Decision

Human contributors are the primary implementors and decision-makers.

AI agents assist by explaining, teaching, reviewing, debugging, and suggesting solutions unless a maintainer explicitly asks for direct edits.

### Reasons

- The team should understand and own the code it produces.
- Agent assistance should improve learning and decision quality.
- Silent implementation can hide complexity and weaken shared understanding.

### Consequences

- Agent behavior is defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Agents should not invent unapproved architecture or scope.
- Humans approve implementation and project changes.

---

## Stretch Features Follow the MVP

### Decision

Stretch features should be considered after the MVP works end to end.

Current stretch features include:

- CLI
- MCP integration
- vector-based retrieval
- monorepo support
- additional programming languages
- private repository support
- guide regeneration
- HTML guide export

### Reasons

- The team has a limited development timeline.
- Completing one coherent workflow is more valuable than partially building many features.
- Stretch work should not destabilize core scanning and guide generation.

### Consequences

- Stretch features should not appear as MVP requirements.
- Moving a stretch feature into the MVP requires an explicit scope decision and documentation update.
